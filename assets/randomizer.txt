My first pair programming project at Juno College. We used a combination of HTML/SASS/JavaScript to complete the project. 

Very proud of the growth I've shown from project 0.5 till now. The code is dryer + cleaner, and most importantly, I got a chance to demonstrate that I can be a productive member of a coding team. 

Technical wins: 
1) learning about race conditions and the limits of the console.log()
2) Working with APIs and how to use user input to manipulate the fetch calls we make
3) The importance of communication and checking in on a team
4) How to support my team in a way that's respectful and inclusive
